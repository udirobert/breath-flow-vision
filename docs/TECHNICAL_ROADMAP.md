## Technical Architecture

### Multichain Data Flow

```
User Action → Frontend → Appropriate Blockchain
├── NFT Operations → Flow Blockchain
├── Social Actions → Lens Protocol
└── IP Registration → Story Protocol
```

### Cross-Chain Identity Management

```typescript
interface MultiChainUser {
  flowAddress: string; // Primary wallet for transactions
  lensProfile: LensProfile; // Social identity
  storyIPAssets: IPAsset[]; // Registered IP assets
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **Flow ↔ Lens**: Link NFT ownership to social profiles
2. **Flow ↔ Story**: Connect NFTs to registered IP assets
3. **Lens ↔ Story**: Attribute social content to IP creators

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs

- Transaction success rate > 95%
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Camera initialization success rate > 90%
- AI analysis completion rate > 95%

### Business KPIs

- User retention rate > 60%
- Creator onboarding completion > 80%
- Average session duration > 10 minutes
- Monthly active creators > 100

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Blockchain network issues**: Implement retry logic and fallbacks
- **AI service downtime**: Create offline analysis capabilities
- **Camera access failures**: Provide manual input alternatives

### Business Risks

- **Low creator adoption**: Implement creator incentive programs
- **User acquisition**: Focus on viral social features via Lens
- **Revenue generation**: Multiple monetization streams across chains

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**:

   - Fix critical dependencies
   - Set up proper environment configuration
   - Begin Flow blockchain integration fixes

2. **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**:

   - Implement database schema
   - Complete Flow NFT functionality
   - Begin Lens Protocol integration

3. **Medium Term (Next Month)**:
   - Complete all blockchain integrations
   - Implement AI and camera features
   - Build core user experience

This roadmap transforms the current demo into a production-ready multichain application while maintaining the sophisticated architecture you've envisioned.
