# Lens Protocol V3 Migration Status

## Completed Tasks

1. âœ… Updated API URLs in enhanced-graphql-client.ts and enhanced-lens-client.ts to point to Lens V3 endpoints
2. âœ… Updated Lens Hub contract address and network configurations in config.ts and environment.ts
3. âœ… Updated useLens.ts hook to fetch real community stats and trending patterns
4. âœ… Replaced mock implementations in src/lib/ai/providers.ts with real API calls
5. âœ… Completed Flow blockchain integration in useFlow.ts with real blockchain interactions
6. âœ… Updated demo implementation in instructorEcosystem.ts to use real API endpoints
7. âœ… Created blockchain verification utility for testing all network connections
8. âœ… Created detailed migration documentation
9. âœ… Created blockchain verification CLI script
10. âœ… Fixed TypeScript errors in blockchain-verifier.ts to use correct method names
11. âœ… Updated IP registration service to use real Story Protocol interactions instead of localStorage
12. âœ… Implemented real EVM batch calls in transaction-client.ts for Flow blockchain
13. âœ… Enhanced instructorEcosystem.ts with real API calls, caching, retry logic, and fallbacks
14. âœ… Replaced mock model loading in model-loader.ts with real TensorFlow.js implementations

## Pending Tasks

1. ðŸ”„ Fix remaining TypeScript import errors across files
2. ðŸ”„ Update any remaining mock implementations (significant progress made)
3. ðŸ”„ Test cross-chain operations
4. ðŸ”„ Update UI components to handle account-based model (vs profile-based) in Lens V3
5. ðŸ”„ Configure proper RPC endpoints for all networks
6. ðŸ”„ Comprehensive testing of ConnectKit/Avara wallet integration
7. ðŸ”„ Optimize TensorFlow.js model loading for different device capabilities
8. ðŸ”„ Add unit and integration tests for new real implementations

## Testing Procedure

To verify the blockchain connections:

1. Run the verification script:

   ```
   node scripts/verify-blockchain-connections.js
   ```

2. Test individual networks:

   ```
   node scripts/verify-blockchain-connections.js --network=lens
   node scripts/verify-blockchain-connections.js --network=flow
   node scripts/verify-blockchain-connections.js --network=story
   ```

3. Only test API endpoints:

   ```
   node scripts/verify-blockchain-connections.js --api-only
   ```

4. Only test wallet integration:
   ```
   node scripts/verify-blockchain-connections.js --wallet-only
   ```

## Notes

- All hooks have been updated to use the new blockchain networks
- Lens Chain requires using account-based model rather than profile-based model
- Error handling has been implemented for all API calls with appropriate fallbacks
- For detailed information about the migration, see [BLOCKCHAIN_MIGRATION.md](./BLOCKCHAIN_MIGRATION.md)
