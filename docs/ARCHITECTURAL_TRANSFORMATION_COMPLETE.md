const vision = useVision({ tier: 'standard', autoStart: true });

// Social Integration  
const social = useLens({ autoConnect: true });

// Flow Blockchain
const flow = useFlow({ network: 'testnet', enableCOA: true });

// Story Protocol
const story = useStory({ isTestnet: true, autoInitialize: true });
```
